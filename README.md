# LK5 Pro - Dual Blower + BLTouch - Marlin 2.1 Firmware

Custom Marlin 2.1.2.5 firmware for the Longer LK5 Pro with MKS Robin E3 v1.1 board.

**Maintained by:** [DreadedZombie](https://github.com/DreadedZombie)

> **Status:** Branch rebuilt from the original 1.0.3E3 (Marlin 2.0.9.2) baseline and upgraded in-place to Marlin 2.1.2.5 with the stock LGT/DWIN touchscreen enabled and BLTouch left disabled.

## Hardware Compatibility

**Board:** MAKERBASE MKS Robin E3 v1.1
**Printer:** Longer LK5 Pro

**Features Currently Enabled:**
- Dual part cooling fan configuration (synchronized blowers)
- DWIN 4.3" LCD serial touchscreen
- Filament runout sensor
- PID temperature control (hotend & bed)
- SD card printing

**Optional Features (can be enabled):**
- BLTouch/3D Touch auto bed leveling (uncomment `WITH_Z_PROBE` in Configuration.h line 85)
- Bilinear auto bed leveling (enabled when BLTouch is active)

**Note:** This firmware is specifically configured for the newer LK5 Pro models with the MKS Robin E3 v1.1 board. If you have an older model with MKS Robin Nano v3.5, you'll need different firmware.

## Improvements Over Stock Firmware

This custom firmware includes advanced Marlin 2.0 features not available in the stock LONGER3D firmware:

### Print Quality Enhancements
- **Linear Advance** - Compensates for extruder pressure dynamics, improves line quality at corners and direction changes (M900 K-factor tunable)
- **S-Curve Acceleration** (optional) - Disabled by default to match the original LK5 motion tuning, but available if you want smoother acceleration profiles
- **Arc Support (G2/G3)** - Native arc commands for smoother curved geometry and smaller file sizes
- **Firmware Retraction** - Consistent retraction control independent of slicer settings

### Advanced Bed Leveling
- **Bilinear Auto Bed Leveling** - 6x6 mesh grid (36 points) for precise bed surface mapping
- **Probe Temperature Compensation** - Adjusts for probe offset changes during temperature variations
- **Leveling Fade Height** - Gradually removes mesh compensation as height increases
- **Manual Corner Leveling** - Guided 4-corner bed leveling with probe verification

### Safety & Reliability
- **Power Loss Recovery** - Automatically saves print state; resume after power interruption
- **Enhanced Thermal Protection** - Multi-layer protection for hotend, bed, and motherboard
- **Endstop Interrupts** - Hardware-based endstop detection for faster collision response
- **Cold Extrusion Prevention** - Blocks extrusion below safe temperature

### User Experience
- **Babystepping** - Real-time Z-offset adjustment during printing (0.1mm resolution)
- **EEPROM Settings** - All settings persist through power cycles (M500/M501)
- **Nozzle Park Feature** - Automatic safe parking during operations
- **Recent Files First** - SD card shows recently used files at the top

### Calibration & Tuning
- **Custom PID Values** - Hardware-specific tuning for LK5 Pro (Hotend: Kp=28.44, Ki=2.41, Kd=83.88)
- **Advanced Motion Control** - Classic Jerk configured for optimal speed/quality balance
- **Filament Runout Detection** - Automatic pause with custom LCD notification (M2003)

## Build

As the firmware is based on Marlin 2.0.x which is built on the core of PlatformIO, the build compiling steps are the same as Marlin 2.0.x. You can directly use [PlatformIO Shell Commands](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation.html#piocore-install-shell-commands), or use IDEs with built-in PlatformIO Core (CLI), for example, [VSCode](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/vscode.html#ide-vscode) and [Atom](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/atom.html). VSCode is recommended.

**Build command:**
```bash
pio run -e mks_robin_e3_maple
```

## Update Firmware

This printer has **two separate firmwares** that can be updated independently:

### 1. Main Controller Firmware (Marlin)

Updates the motherboard (MKS Robin E3 v1.1) with your custom Marlin firmware:

1. Enter the `.pio\build\mks_robin_e3_maple` directory
2. Rename `Robin_e3.bin` to `firmware.bin`
3. Copy `firmware.bin` to the **root directory** of your SD card
4. Insert the SD card into the motherboard
5. Power on the printer - you should see the update interface
6. Wait for update to complete (progress bar will show)

### 2. Display Firmware (DWIN Touchscreen)

Updates the graphics, icons, fonts, and UI elements on the 4.3" DWIN LCD touchscreen:

1. Format an SD card as FAT32
2. Copy all files from the `Firmware/assets/` folder to the **root directory** of the SD card
   - This includes all `bmp_*.bin` files (UI graphics/icons)
   - And `FontUNIGBK.bin` (font file)
3. Insert the SD card into the printer
4. Power on the printer
5. The display will automatically detect and update its graphics
6. Wait for the update to complete (may take a few minutes)

**Note:** You only need to update the display firmware if you've customized the UI graphics or if you're experiencing display issues. The display firmware is in the `Firmware/assets/` folder.
